# Credit-Score-Classification
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the probability of credit default and assigning a corresponding credit score bracket to individuals. The objective is to apply real-world credit risk principles—such as those from Basel regulations—and economic theory to support financial decision-making.


The project will include:

	•	Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis of financial indicators.
	•	Implementation of classification models to predict creditworthiness.
	•	Integration of risk-based thresholds aligned with practical credit scoring standards.

Currently under development. Final evaluation metrics and business applications will be added soon.
